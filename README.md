## Presenting to an Audience
Presenting to an audience, open index.html in Chrome and enter the fullscreen mode (View - 'Enter Full Screen'). The arrow keys shown in the lower right corner correspond to the arrows on the keyboard. 'Escape' provides an overview for all slides and allows to quickly navigate to a particular slide. The 'B' key fades slide into a black screen to avoid distractions while talking. Mirroring the screen, a mobile phone or a tablet can be used as presenter device, arrow keys are replced with swipes.
